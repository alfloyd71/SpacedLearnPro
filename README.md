# Spaced Learn Pro
Flashcards app that uses the "flashcard box system" to organize and use flashcards in a systematic way to enhance learning through spaced repetition.

Box Levels: Each box represents a different level of familiarity or mastery:

Box 1 (New Material): This box contains new flashcards or cards that the learner is less familiar with.
Box 2 (Review): Flashcards that have been successfully recalled a few times are moved to this box for regular review.
Box 3 (Mastery): Cards from Box 2 that have been consistently recalled correctly are promoted to this box for less frequent review.
Optional Boxes: Some systems may include additional boxes for more advanced levels of mastery, such as Box 4 and Box 5.
